After we have our first few sessions, The Muse will begin to send out a monthly newsletter featuring the work of our members. Submissions can include, but is not limited to, digital art, poetry, and short stories.

If you're interested in submitting your work, you can either send it via <a href="mailto:admin@chattymuse.com">email</a>, or talk to a leader after a Monday Muse session.
